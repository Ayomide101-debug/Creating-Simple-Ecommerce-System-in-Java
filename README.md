Create a new Java project called "ecommerce-system"

Create the package structure under src:

com.ecommerce

com.ecommerce.orders

com.ecommerce.main

Create each class in its respective package

Right-click on the project â†’ Build Project

Run Main.java (it has the main method)

Key Fixes Applied:
Proper package declarations in all files

Correct import statements where needed

Consistent naming conventions (productId instead of productID)

Main class moved to proper package (com.ecommerce.main)

All files in correct directory structure

Proper encapsulation with getters/setters

This version should compile and run without the "Order cannot be resolved" error. The package structure and imports are now correctly organized according to Java best practices.
